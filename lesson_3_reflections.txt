When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
I should keep my files both local and remote whenever i updated it so whenever I want to use it anywhere I can pull it remotely usig github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might pull changes manually so I can work offline rather than working 
online.
